# **Setup Script**

## Intro

This basic set of shell files is a first attempt at writing basic shell scripts makeing installing basic software a bit quicker, or easier if you forget things like docker and global npm packages all the time. If this is buggy or inifficeint it is because i don';t really know what i am doing in shell yet.

## Installation and use

`git clone https://github.com/DAVE4547/setup.git`

`cd setup`

`bash setup.sh`
